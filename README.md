# Medical image super-resolution
 
Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is a powerful model that has shown remarkable performance in recovering high-resolution (HR) images from real-world low-resolution (LR) images. In this work, we fine-tune the pre-trained Real-ESRGAN model for medical image super-resolution. We use the STARE dataset and the Tuberculosis chest X-rays (Shenzhen) dataset for fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model can better preserve fine details and produce more realistic images. 

Below are the download links of chest X-ray and retinal datasets.
