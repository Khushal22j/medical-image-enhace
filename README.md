# Medical image super-resolution
 
In this work, we fine-tune the pre-trained Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) model to improve the resolution and quality of chest X-ray and retinal images. We use the STARE dataset and the Tuberculosis chest X-rays (Shenzhen) dataset for fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model can better preserve fine details and produce more realistic images. 

Below are the download links of chest X-ray and retinal datasets.

The Real-ESRGAN code is borrowed from https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.

Results for chest x-ray and retinal images are shown in the following figures.

# Retinal images 

Columns 1–4 are degraded LR images, original Real-ESRGAN outputs, fine-tuned Real-ESRGAN outputs, and ground truth HR images.

# Chest X-ray images 

Columns 1–4 are degraded LR images, original Real-ESRGAN outputs, fine-tuned Real-ESRGAN outputs, and ground truth HR images.
