# medical-image-super-resolution
 
In this project, we use the Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) model for medical image super-resolution.
In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator networks of the 
Real-ESRGAN model are fine-tuned using medical image datasets.

In this project, we worked on retinal images - chest X-ray images. We used the STARE dataset of retinal images and Tuberculosis Chest X-rays (Shenzhen) dataset.
Our fine-tuned model produces more accurate and natural textures, and the output images have better detail and resolution compared to the original real-esrgan model.

All details and fine-tuning parameters are available in the finetune_realesrgan_x4plus.yml file.

It is also possible to test the original real-esrgan model and fine-tuned model in the fine_tune_retinal.ipynb and fine_tune_chest_x_rays.ipynb files.

The Real-ESRGAN code is borrowed from https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.

Below are some outputs of the real-esrgan model and the fine-tuned model:

Columns 1â€“4 are the high-resolution ground truth images, LR degraded images, the outputs of the original Real-ESRGAN, and the outputs of the fine-tuned Real-ESRGAN.
